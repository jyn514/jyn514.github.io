<p>Run <code>git reflog</code>, it shows you all the recent commits you were on.</p>

<p>The error probably looks like this:</p>
<pre class="z-code"><code><span class="z-text z-plain">$ git push

<p>This is totally normal. Git just gives absolutely awful error messages. Run <code>git push --force-with-lease</code> and it should work fine.</p>
<p>Be careful using <code>--force</code>. 99% of the time it works. The other 1% someone else pushed to your branch and you just deleted their work. They will not be happy.</p>

<p>Get rid of it. We don't want it. If you have changes since the latest commit, save them somewhere (e.g. <code>git stash</code>).
Then run <code>git reset --hard HEAD~</code>. Now go to the step above about <code>--force-with-lease</code>.</p>

<p>Git doesn't think you're on a branch or tag.</p>
<p>This is <em>not</em> the same as being on a commit that's not in any branch or tag. It's perfectly possible
to be on the same commit as the latest <code>main</code> and still have a detached HEAD. It just means that
any new commit you make in this state won't be on a branch.</p>

<p><strong>DO NOT DO THIS IF YOU HAVE WORK YOU WANT TO SAVE!!!</strong></p>
<p>Run <code>git checkout --force $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref origin/HEAD)</code>. If that gives an error for any reason try <code>git checkout --force origin/master </code>or <code>origin/main</code> instead. If none of those work IDK what to tell you maybe wiping the repo is the best idea after all. Good luck.</p>

<p>Ok. Pick which branch you want to put your work on. I'm going to pick <code>bark</code> because branches have bark. haha</p>
<p>Does the commit you're on have the work you want to save?</p>

</h5>
<p>Run <code>git branch --delete bark &amp;&amp; git checkout --branch bark</code>. This is the least invasive way to fix things;
whatever untracked code is in your working directory won't be modified, and the old branch will still be in your reflog if you really need it. If you don't know what that means, that's ok, you're on the right branch now and you can push it wherever you need.</p>

<p>I'm going to assume the error looks something like this:</p>
<pre class="z-code"><code><span class="z-text z-plain">error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by reset:
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">        src/tools/rls/Cargo.toml

</span></code></pre>
<p>There are three things I can think of that could be going wrong here:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You made some changes and didn't commit them. Commit them now. Go. Do it. <code>git add src/tools/rls &amp;&amp; git commit</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is in a submodule and git got confused. If you don't know what a submodule is, mentally replace it with "code I have never modified and will never want to modify". You can ignore this by running <code>git submodule deinit -f src/tools/rls</code> (or whichever directory the submodule starts in - you can check with <code>git submodule status</code>).</p>
<p><strong>DO NOT DO THIS</strong> if you have made changes to that directory you want to save. Git will destroy all you hold dear. It is a sharp and powerful tool. You might call it ... a subtle knife.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This used to be a submodule and it's no longer a submodule. You tried the <code>deinit</code> thing above and it didn't help. Try <code>rm -rf src/tools/rls</code>. This does exactly what it looks like, don't do it if you want to save your work.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If none of those fix it, glhf sucks to be you</p>

<p>yes this is a very specific problem. no I'm not going to take it out of the blog.</p>
<p>This happens because your submodules are out of date. Run <code>./x.py --help</code>, which updates submodules for you.
Under the hood this is running the equivalent of <code>git submodule update --init --recursive</code> which makes sure all the rust tool submodules are up to date.</p>

<p>First make your changes. Then run <code>git add .</code></p>
<p>If you want to change the latest commit you made, run <code>git commit --amend</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to change an earlier commit, run <code>git commit --fixup &lt;earlier commit&gt; &amp;&amp; git rebase -i --autosquash &lt;earlier commit&gt;~</code>. Type the <code>~</code> literally but remove the <code>&lt;&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>If you don't know which commit you want to change, but you know it's a commit you made since you made this branch, install
<a href="https://github.com/tummychow/git-absorb/">https://github.com/tummychow/git-absorb/</a> then run the <code>autosquash</code> command from above. Absorb does magic to pick the right commits.</p>
<p>If you want to change a commit that's already on master, don't. Just don't.
If you're <em>really</em>, <em>truly</em> convinced you need to, and you're <em>sure</em> no one else minds (which in practice is probably never true), you can use <a href="https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo">https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo</a>.</p>

<p>Run <code>git rebase -i $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref origin/HEAD)</code> (or whatever your default branch is). Then go up to the bit about "failed to push some refs" above.</p>
<p>Yes this will probably cause conflicts. No I don't know how to avoid that, probably some nonsense with <code>git reset $(git merge-base $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref origin/HEAD)) &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit</code> or whatever. Don't blame me if that doesn't work, I didn't test it. Also it throws away all the history, you keep the work but not the commit messages, you have to fish them up again with <code>git reflog</code> or <code>git for-each-ref --sort=committerdate refs/heads/ | tail -n1 | cut -d' ' -f1 | xargs git log</code>.</p>

<p>yeah no that's it have fun kid</p>
<p>ok no actually one more thing â€”</p>
<p>can I talk for a second about how absolutely <em>awful</em> every error message I've quoted here is. they are so bad I don't even refer to them when explaining what went wrong.
half the time they point you to completely the wrong solution; the other half they give no indication at all of why something went wrong.</p>
<p>this is not how it should be. things can be better. here is an error message for the "push after rebase" that is actually useful:</p>
<pre class="z-code"><code><span class="z-text z-plain">$ git push
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">To git@github.com:jyn514/rust.git (simplify-storage -&gt; origin/simplify-storage)
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">error: failed to push 1 commit to &#39;origin&#39;
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">hint: Both your current branch and the remote branch have changed since the last time you pushed changes.
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">hint: The commits locally and in your remote have the same descriptions, and you just finished a rebase.

</span><span class="z-text z-plain">note: See https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing for more information about rebasing.
</span></code></pre>
<p>See how that's helpful? see how you understand more after reading it than before? unlike the absolutely useless error before</p>
<p>god ok that's it for real I'm done now</p>
<h3 id="update-now-that-this-is-apparently-popular">update now that this is apparently popular<a class="zola-anchor" href="#update-now-that-this-is-apparently-popular" aria-label="Anchor link for: update-now-that-this-is-apparently-popular"></a>
</h3>
<p>go read https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/git.html too, it's the most comprehensive document on rebase workflows that I've seen. no the official docs don't count, if you don't explain the common errors you run into it's not comprehensive. also the manpages are useless unless you already know what the command does in which case WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THE MAN PAGE</p>
<p>also go read my twitter where you can read more nonsense like me complaining about how I can't convince myself to go to sleep <a href="https://twitter.com/jynelson514/">https://twitter.com/jynelson514/</a></p>
