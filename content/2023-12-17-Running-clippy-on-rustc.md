Clippy is an official tool for linting your code. It's named after the venerable *Clippit Office
Assistant* from Windows XP. It has like a bajillion lints. It works really well.

Unfortunately, the rust compiler has a [weird bespoke build system](./2023-01-12-Bootstrapping-Rust-in-2023.md),
so adding things to it is rather difficult. As a result, I have been trying to add a reliable `x clippy` command to the build system for going on *checks notes* [three and a half years now][#77351].

[#77351]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77351.

This blog post is about what makes it hard, how I fixed it, and why it took so long.

Say you don't know anything about compilers or bootstrapping. How might you approach this problem?
Well, a good first try is probably just to run `cargo clippy`. It works everywhere else, after all. How bad could it be?

```

Well. That wasn't particularly helpful now, was it. The problem, as explained in more detail in
[the rustc dev guide], is that standard library uses unstable features that may not match the
features available in our default Rust toolchain. As a result, it only supports exactly two versions
of the compiler: the previous beta, and the latest commit on the master branch.

[the rustc dev guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/building/bootstrapping.html

Now, we can't use the previous beta directly because that's gated behind a `#[cfg(bootstrap)]` attribute,
but we *can* jerry-rig that into the build system.

```
```
