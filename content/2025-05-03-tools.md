description: tools i use or want to use
---
i care a lot about my tools. i have very high standards for tools along some axes, and low standards along othersâ€”but that's the topic of a different blog post. this post is about the tools i *do* use, and about tools i have my eye on and may use in the future. hopefully it will be useful to other people, such as programmers, sysadmins, etc.

this is also not a description of *how* i use these tools, which also deserves its own blog post (i pride myself on integrating tools that were not designed to integrate with each other). this is just a list of the tools themselves.

i have a version of [tools i have my eye on](#tools-i-have-my-eye-on) for myself that i keep regularly updated. i will probably not keep this public copy updated, unless i find a tool that's sufficiently good i want to tell people about it.

i'm always on the lookout for more useful tools. if you have a tool you use regularly that's not on this list (and not specific to a single language ecosystem), please let me know. the one exception is containerization software. i am interested in tools to *interact* with containers, but at this time i am not looking for more container hosts (podman, kubernetes, vagrant, lxc, systemd-nspawn, firejail, chroot, etc).
## tools i use
### basics
you have probably seen someone else recommend these tools. it's not just hype. they are useful.
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep): file contents searching
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd): file name searching
- [jq](https://jqlang.org/): json processing. note that most data formats can be converted to json, which i recommend over [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) or other format-specific filtering tools; the exception is XML and things isomorphic to it, which [cannot be represented in json with fidelity](https://fwslc.blogspot.com/2014/10/json-m.html). i tried a rewrite, [jaq](https://github.com/01mf02/jaq), that promised to be faster, but it had fewer features and it turns out that i rarely care about the speed of jq.
- [`killall`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/killall.1.html): kill matching processes
- [`pkill`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/pkill): kill specific matching process
### shell
[zsh](https://docs.jade.fyi/zsh/zsh.html#Introduction-1). i cannot in good conscience recommend this to anyone else; most people will be better served by [fish](https://fishshell.com/). i just have sunk cost from learning entirely too much bash syntax in my misspent youth.

i tried [xonsh](https://xon.sh/) and was annoyed by how poorly python variables interact with regular shell variables.

i was very pleasantly surprised by [powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/), which it turns out runs on linux these days. it has actual data types instead of just strings, which means you aren't constantly doing string munging in a language not designed for it. i would probably use it interactively if i were willing to give up my sunk cost on bash syntax.

i tried [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/), which is like powershell but not made by microsoft and without the .NET integration. i found it extremely verbose - it's a good scripting language but not a good interactive shell. also it breaks a bunch of bash syntax for no reason, even when the syntax is unambiguous. (much of bash's syntax *is* ambiguous and i can forgive breaking that.)
### editor
i use [neovim](https://neovim.io/) with a [truly absurd amount of custom configuration](https://github.com/jyn514/dotfiles/blob/master/config/nvim.lua). i cannot in good conscience recommend this to anyone else; most people will be better served by vscode and a few plugins.

i tried various other editors and was disappointed by all of them. `kakoune` required more configuration than i was willing to put in to just to get a "basic" experience. `helix` was extraordinarily resistant to being configured past very basic key remapping (for a while i forked it, but this didn't scale very well for the amount of configuration i wanted). VSCode dropped keystrokes and was generally laggy, both of which got worse when i installed a vim plugin. `zed` had various issues with the integrated terminal and window management (although this may have changed since i tried it in mid-2024). i have not tried `emacs` and dread the day i do because it will probably suck up weeks of my time.
### terminal multiplexing
i use [a fork](https://github.com/jyn514/tmux/tree/working) of tmux with [more absurd amounts of configuration](https://github.com/jyn514/dotfiles/blob/master/config/tmux.conf). again, i cannot in good conscience recommend this to anyone else. most people will be better served by the integrated terminal in vscode (i spent a couple weeks on trying to get back ctrl-click for filepaths alone). vscode also works on windows MSVC, unlike terminal multiplexers.

various people have recommended [zellij](https://zellij.dev/) to me. i think zellij is good if you like the default keybinds, or if you use a terminal multiplexer infrequently enough that having the basic commands on-screen is helpful for you. i found that the default keybinds interfered with a bunch of programs and didn't look further into it.

wezterm and kitty are not really in the running because they don't have session save/resume.
### debugging
- [`set -x`](https://docs.jade.fyi/zsh/zsh.html#index-XTRACE): trace shell programs
- [`GIT_TRACE`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Environment-Variables#_debugging): trace git commands
- [`CARGO_LOG`](https://doc.crates.io/contrib/implementation/debugging.html#logging): trace [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) commands
- [strace](https://strace.io/): trace system calls. this doesn't exist on macOS; it has a counterpart, dtruss, which [kinda sorta mostly works](https://poweruser.blog/using-dtrace-with-sip-enabled-3826a352e64b).
- [rr](https://rr-project.org/): time travel debugging. this doesn't exist on macOS; if you know a counterpart *please* let me know.
### C/C++ tools
- for cmake projects: [`cmake -G Ninja`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#cmdoption-cmake-G). uses [`ninja`](https://ninja-build.org/manual.html#_comparison_to_make) instead of `make`, improving compile times and with a much nicer progress bar.
- for cmake projects: [`cmake -D CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=On`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS.html). Generates a `compile_commands.json` file that most LSPs know how to read.
- for everything else: [`bear`](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear). like above, but works for arbitrary build systems.
### rust tools
- [`bacon`](https://github.com/Canop/bacon/): background code checker
- [`cargo tree -i`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-tree.html#tree-options): figure out why a package was built
### "everything else"
- [btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop): like top but easier to use and easier to understand the output
- [tailscale](https://tailscale.com/): software-defined networking. i mainly use it for easy NAT punching and DDNS, but it's much more flexible than that.
- [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/): flexible and pretty markdown editor. i use it for journaling and drafting blog posts. [obsidian sync](https://obsidian.md/sync) is not required but "just works" and makes it much more convenient; it's nice to have access to the same files everywhere.
- [`#:~:text=xyz`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Fragment/Text_fragments): link to specifically the text "xyz" on a web page. works in firefox since around the end of 2024, and in chrome since a lot earlier.
## tools i have my eye on
i either use these occasionally enough i need a reference, or haven't used them yet but want to.
